# 2025 WTD Analytics & Trend Tracker Dashboard

_A SQL + Python + Power BI case study on booking trend forecasting & revenue optimization_  
_Created for learning and portfolio display purposes_

---

## Project Overview

This case simulates a real-world analytics challenge in the travel industry —  
focused on how to forecast booking performance, optimize revenue, and monitor product trends using a combination of:

- Week-to-Date (WTD) ratio analysis  
- SQL-based operational insight
- Power BI dashboard storytelling

---

## Objectives

1. Analyze historical passenger booking trends  
2. Estimate WTD booking ratios by weekday & product  
3. Build a dashboard to monitor bookings in real-time  
4. Identify performance risk due to poor forecasting  
5. Answer key SQL business questions based on the star schema
