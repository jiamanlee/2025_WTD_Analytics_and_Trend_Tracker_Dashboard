📊 WTD Analytics & Trend Tracker

A SQL + Python + Power BI case study on booking trend forecasting & revenue optimization
Created for learning and portfolio display purposes

⸻

🚀 Project Overview

This case simulates a real-world analytics challenge in the travel industry —
focused on how to forecast booking performance, optimize revenue, and monitor product trends using a combination of:
	•	📈 Week-to-Date (WTD) ratio analysis
	•	🧪 SQL-based operational insight
	•	📊 Power BI dashboard storytelling

⸻

🧠 Objectives
	1.	Analyze historical passenger booking trends
	2.	Estimate WTD booking ratios by weekday & product
	3.	Build a dashboard to monitor bookings in real-time
	4.	Identify performance risk due to poor forecasting
	5.	Answer key SQL business questions based on the star schema

Insight: Caribbean products build more evenly across weekdays, while Europe ramps up near weekends. Alaska shows flat, B2B-like behavior.

📌 Key Takeaways
	•	Overestimating WTD → late discounts, revenue loss
	•	Underestimating WTD → early discounts, margin erosion
	•	Sunday is consistently weakest across all products
	•	Saturday often shows no data due to operational cutoff
